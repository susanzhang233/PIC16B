    "# Basic Network Analysis with NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few lectures, we'll consider data analysis and modeling with *network data.* There are many topics at the intersection of networks and computation (indeed, this is my research area). We'll spend one day on network basics, one day on common data science tasks, and one day on the rather relevant topic of epidemics on networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lecture, we'll introduce the NetworkX package for working with network data, and see how to perform some simple manipulations, visualizations, and analyses. \n",

    "### A Note on Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX is an extremely accessible and popular package for working with network data. However, it's not the most *performant* package, and for complex operations on large graphs, other tools should often be prefered. A common recommendation is the [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html) package. For problems that are primarily mathematical in nature, working with matrix representations of graphs may be a better choice. "

More sophisticated network visualizations can be constructed through other tools, many of which are interoperable with Networkx. One high quality choice is the [Bokeh package](http://holoviews.org/user_guide/Network_Graphs.html) for complex interactive graphics, while [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/network-graphs/) also offers a good solution. For our purposes today, though, the built-in `nx.draw()` is fine. "

Node 0 is Mr. Hi himself, and Node 33 is the club president. As you can see, the two new clubs closely align with social relationships.
